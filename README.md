https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/79518466-57b7-4a6b-871f-17b0b43d4d11

# Functionality

The POS System is based on a Cake Bakery that lets the cashier add items and generate bills when the customer buys goods. After generating bills, there is an option to generate Tax Transaction Files for either a specific bill only or for all the bills.

The TAX system is based on the new Government tax generations. It lets a government employee open a specific Tax Transaction File, check for non profit or invalid records, edit or delete the invalid records and generate a tax rate for it. 

These systems were built solely for Academic Purposes and they may not be accurate at points. The whole Module recieved an A grade.
